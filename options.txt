# This is a sample options file for Uroboros.
# For the avoidance of doubt, this file is released into the public domain,
# just like Uroboros itself.
# The format for options is `option = value`.  Whitespace is not optional.
# Boolean options can be enabled with "y" or "yes" (no quotes) or disabled
# with "n" or "no".
# This file is read line-by-line, and as such only one option is permitted per
# line.  Lines that begin with a # will be ignored, as will blank lines.
# All lines, including comment lines, must be 80 characters long or less.
# If the same option is set more than once, later values will take precedence.


# Key bindings


# Key bindings can be defined using the character that gets output from
# pressing that key.  A capital letter will require you to press the SHIFT key
# in-game.  As a special case, Uroboros will accept KEY_LEFT, KEY_RIGHT,
# KEY_UP, and KEY_DOWN for the arrow keys and SPACE for the space bar.
move_up = KEY_UP
move_down = KEY_DOWN
move_left = KEY_LEFT
move_right = KEY_RIGHT

# Remove the # at the beginning of the following lines to enable WASD movement:
#move_up = w
#move_down = s
#move_left = a
#move_right = d

# Old-schoolers may prefer these vi-like key bindings:
#move_left = h
#move_down = j
#move_up = k
#move_right = l


# These keys will cause your snake to speed up or slow down.
speed_up = =
slow_down = -


# Miscellaneous keybindings.
pause_key = p
quit_key = q
show_version = v
show_license = c


# Display settings


# Disabling color will cause Uroboros to use an alternative character set which
# should hopefully be more visible on terminals which don't support color.
color = yes
