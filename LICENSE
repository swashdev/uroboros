This is public domain software.  Feel free to do whatever you want with it
so long as you don't hold me liable for any damages - there is no warranty.

If you want to pay me back for it, you can do so by taking ten minutes or
more out of each day to remind yourself that you are valuable and your life
is worth living, and treating yourself like someone worth taking care of.
This software is already free; now free yourself.
